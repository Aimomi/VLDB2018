\begin{abstract}
Privacy is an important concern for our society where sharing data with partners or releasing data to the
public is a frequent occurrence. Some of the techniques that are being used to achieve privacy are to remove
identifiers, alter quasi-identifiers, and perturb values. Unfortunately, these approaches suffer from two
limitations. First, it has been shown that private information can still be leaked if attackers possess
some background knowledge or other information sources. Second, they do not take into account the
adverse impact these methods will have on the utility of the released data.

In this paper, we propose a method that meets both requirements. Our method called \textit{table-GAN}, using generative adversarial networks (GANs), synthesizes fake tables that are statistically similar to the original table yet do not incur information leakage.

We show that the machine learning models trained using our synthetic tables exhibit performance that
is similar to that of models trained using the original table for unknown testing cases. We call this
property \textit{model compatibility}. We believe that anonymization/perturbation/synthesis methods
without model compatibility are rather meaningless.

We used four real-world datasets from four
different domains for our experiments and conducted in-depth comparisons with state-of- the-art
anonymization\slash perturbation\slash generation techniques. Throughout our experiments, only our method consistently shows balance between privacy level and model compatibility.
% Even after removing identifiers, altering quasi-identifiers, and perturbing values, private information can be leaked if attackers possess some background knowledge or other information sources.

% We propose a method to synthesize fake tables using generative adversarial networks (GANs). Our method, which is called \textit{table-GAN}, is trained using the original table and generates synthetic tables that are statistically similar to the original table but that do not incur information leakage.

% We also show that machine learning models trained using the synthetic tables exhibit performance that is similar to that of models trained using the original table for unknown testing cases. We call this property \textit{model compatibility}. Any anonymization/perturbation/synthesis methods without model compatibility are rather meaningless.

% In general, a high (resp. low) privacy level implies a low (resp. high) model compatibility (e.g., a table after substantial modifications will not leak any real information, but its model compatibility will be very poor). Thus, the balance between privacy level and model compatibility is very important.

% We used four real-world datasets from four different domains for our experiments and conducted in-depth comparisons with state-of-the-art anonymization/perturbation/generation techniques.  Our method presents the best trade-off between privacy and model compatibility.

% \section{Final Remarks and Future Work}
% Existing anonymization methods show good model compatibility (except the classification tests in the Health and LACity datasets). However, their privacy level is weaker than table-GAN, as shown in the DCR tests.

% Our table-GAN shows very stable model compatibility in all datasets and its privacy level is much higher than other baseline methods. We will extend our method to process all data types of relation databases.

\section{Conclusion}
We proposed a method named table-GAN to synthesize fake tables that are statistically similar to the original table. Moreover, the synthetic tables generated using our method show model compatibility that is as good as that of anonymization techniques that do not change sensitive attributes. To our knowledge, our method is the first attempt to synthesize general relational databases using deep learning techniques.

We conducted thorough experiments using four real-world datasets that have at most millions of records and tens of attributes. The runtime to synthesize such large databases is approximately 20 minutes with our entry-level servers due to the advancements in GPU technology. During statistical, distance to the closest record, and model compatibility tests, table-GAN exhibits the best trade-off between privacy level and model compatibility.
